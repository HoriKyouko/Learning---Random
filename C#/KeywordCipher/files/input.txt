Dear Holly,

I know you don't exist right now; because you haven't been born or even produced yet, but
I wanted to write a letter to you anyways. In some amount of months, 6-9 months, you will
be born and will be sent to me on a big flying bird we humans like to call planes. Now
hopefully you'll be safe and strong during the flight so you won't be scared, and when you
land I'll be sure to pick you up from a place we call an airport. We'll then bring you home
to live in our family and you'll be loved and trained by me.

With Love and Affection
