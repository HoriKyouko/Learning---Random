This project was to serve as a practice in learning WebGL from the mdn tutorial:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial

Along the way I had to fix a few things from the tutorial, namely the problem with
cross-origin when it comes to videos and images. It was fun and rewarding
to code it up all be it a pain in the butt to find my spelling errors when I made
them. :P
